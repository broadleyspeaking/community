# Slack Community (http://slack.broadleyspeaking.co.nz)

## The Vision

To bring the people who have done it, to the people who are doing it.

## The Mission

Deliver the best advice, content and connections to help each member of the community at least once a week.

## How are we going to acheive this?

### Expectations of Us

As being part of the community you will receive insights, offers of help, and advice. 

These are the following activities to expect at least once a week from us:
* We will source the best and most relevant events into our calendar in the #events channel
* We will post filtered, reviewed and relevant news in the #newsworthy channel (i.e. no sensationalist/click-bait articles)
* We will bring one new founder into the group
* We will grow the community through participating external advisors (i.e. investors, legal, financial, governance etc.)

### Expectations of You

This is a community where there is a requirement of participation to help create the environment we can all benefit from, and not just some of us.

These are the following activities we expect at least once a week from you:
* Participate in the Friday 4pm check-in/reflection of the Good, Bad and Ugly parts of your week
* Ask for help
* Help someone
* Share a piece of content you've gained value from
* To tell one business owner who isn't part of this community, about this community

The ultimate question we want you to be able to keep relevant is asking yourself:
 `"What's the last nice thing you've done for someone in this community?"`
